## Program: plot1.R
## Student: Félix D. Mejía

## Abstract
###### This assignment uses data from "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set", which includes measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
###### This program will generate file "plot1.png", a frequency histogram of Global Active Power measured in KiloWatts.
